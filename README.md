# DB Connection
Until I work on creating a web app, the database credentials are stored in config.ini
This file is included in the gitinore to avoid version controlling passwords

Create a config.ini in the same folder as scryfall.py in this format:
    <p>
    [mysql]<br>
    user = your_user<br>
    password = your_password<br>
    host = localhost<br>
    database = your_database
    </p>
